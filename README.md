# records-app

> A Vue.js project
- GA news lab sent different public records requests to different agencies and this walks you through the process of getting responses. Jackie started and didn't have a chance to finish. Engine is set up but styling is not and it's just using sample data. Not expecting to use this, but maybe!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
